I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's

Here, I work with [Dr. Rachael E. Jack](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/rachaeljack/) on a project entitled *Building a Culturally Flexible Model of Face Signalling for Social 
Robots*.

### How I Got Here

I was born in Germany and lived there until I was 16. At that time I applied to and got into the [United World College Costa Rica](http://en.uwccostarica.org/). During my two years in Costa Rica, I was involved in a range of activities including:

<ul>
  <li>Leading and directing a musical which can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/38733243)</li>
  <li>Clowning (as Patch Adams) in a Rehabilitation Centre</li>
  <li>Spending a week in a Bri Bri village (indiginous people of Costa Rica)</li>
  <li>Cleaning and improving a slum in San Jos√©</li>
</ul>

After my time in Costa Rica, I spent half a year as an intern in the practice of a GP in Germany before living in Barcelona for 4 months - to improve my Spanish. 

In 2013, I started my B.Sc. in Psychology (Hons) at the [**University of Glasgow**](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) which I completed in 2017 with a First. During my Bachelor, I also had the opportunity to spend a year abroad at the [**University of Hong Kong**](https://www.hku.hk/).

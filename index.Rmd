I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/). Here, I am currently completing my M.Sc. in Psychological Research Methods.
I work with [Dr. Rachael Jack](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/rachaeljack/) on establishing a syntax for facial expressions.

### How I Got Here

I was born in Germany and lived there until I was 16. At that time I applied to and got into the [United World College Costa Rica](http://en.uwccostarica.org/). During my two years in Costa Rica, I was involved in a range of activities including:

<ul>
  <li>Leading and directing a musical which can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/38733243)</li>
  <li>Clowning (as Patch Adams) in a Rehabilitation Centre</li>
  <li>Spending a week in a Bri Bri village (indiginous people of Costa Rica)</li>
  <li>Cleaning and improving a slum in San Jos√©</li>
</ul>
